## Todo

### 2. **Technologies**

### 3. **Architecture**

#### **Component-Based Architecture**

1. **Task Component**: Represents a single task with options to edit, delete, and mark as complete.
2. **TaskList Component**: Displays a list of tasks and filters or sorts them based on user input.
3. **AddTask Component**: Provides a form for adding new tasks.
4. **EditTask Component**: Allows editing of an existing task.
5. **Header and Footer Components**: Common components for application navigation and information.

### 4. **Implementation Steps**

#### **1. Set Up the Project**

- Use Create React App or Vite to bootstrap your project.

```bash
npx create-react-app todo-list-app
# or
npm init vite@latest todo-list-app --template react
```

#### **2. Create Components**

- Design and develop components based on the architecture outlined.

#### **3. Implement State Management**

- Set up Redux or Context API for managing global state.

#### **4. Integrate Backend**

- Set up a backend server using Express.js and connect it with MongoDB.
- Implement API routes for CRUD operations on tasks and user management.

#### **5. Implement Authentication**

- Use JWT for secure authentication and implement login/signup pages.

#### **6. Add Features**

- Develop additional features like filtering, sorting, notifications, and PWA capabilities.

#### **7. Testing**

- Write unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

#### **8. Deployment**

- Deploy the frontend and backend to platforms like Netlify, Vercel, Heroku, etc.

### 5. **Best Practices**

- **Code Organization**: Keep components, hooks, and styles organized in separate folders.
- **Reusable Components**: Create reusable components for buttons, forms, modals, etc.
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and user feedback.
- **Performance Optimization**: Use techniques like lazy loading and memoization to optimize performance.
- **Security**: Ensure secure handling of user data and authentication processes.

By following this guide, you should be able to create a robust and feature-rich to-do list app with React.js.
